This project is about quick digital consultation without login

This app offers patients quick digital consultation without logging in.

Let patients describe symptoms via a chat-like interface

Provide doctor recommendations based on symptoms

Allow patients to book consultations by picking doctors, time slots, and consultation modes (audio, video call, whatsapp, in-person etc.)

Show a history of past consultations and prescriptions of patient

You to need try and give code as simple as possible

currently project is just working on prototype so make a UI with mock data so that we can show the workflow to clients

Required features:

1. users should just be able to provide mobile number (no login)
2. on landing they should be prompted with nice chat interface where they can send their symptoms
3. chat interface will ask follow ups based on symptoms to classify in broader categories like (eye specialist needed, orthopedic needed, etc) (for now just hardcode the data and create mockups)
4. based on classification doctors are suggested
5. on choosing a doctor show a page where patient can select preferred consultation mode, time slot
