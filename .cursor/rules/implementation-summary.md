## Testing Recommendations

1. Conduct extensive user testing on the booking flow
2. Test mobile responsiveness across different devices
3. Verify accessibility compliance
4. Performance test with larger datasets

## Database Implementation Plan

Now that we have a detailed database schema defined in `db-schema.sql`, the implementation plan should focus on:

1. Setting up a PostgreSQL database instance
2. Creating the tables and relationships defined in the schema
3. Creating API endpoints for data retrieval and manipulation
4. Implementing robust error handling and validation

When moving from the current localStorage-based prototype to a full database implementation, we should ensure data migration capabilities are built to preserve existing user data.
